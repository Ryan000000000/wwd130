        <p> If you are a thrill seeker, you will love rafthing the North Fork of the American River with it's class IV and V rapids! This is our most challenging trip and, while not for the faint of heart, it is also our most scenic. With both challenging rapids and beautiful scenery, this trip has the best of both worlds!
