      <p>
        Welcome to my resume.  I hope that you will find it useful.  Let me tell you a little bit about myself.  I live in Newcastle, California.  I am 21 years old, and am the oldest of three children. I have one brother and one sister.  I have Aspergers Syndrome.  I work best in quiet environments with little distractions.  I am a very linear thinker and I that is why I enjoy subjects like math, science, and computer programing, because they are very straight forward and do not involve a lot of abstract thoughts.  
I am a very dedicated worker and always try to do my best.  I am very reliable.  I am currently serving on a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  I am a service missionary, so I still live at home with my family, but I go out during the day to serve with different organizations throughout the Sacramento, California area.  I will complete my mission service in June of 2023.
I would like to one day become a computer programmer because I will most likely get to work in a quiet environment and, as mentioned above, I enjoy computer programming because it is very direct.
I also enjoy helping others accomplish their goals.  As part of my mission, I have really learned to love serving people and helping them out when they need it.  I feel a great sense of accomplishment when I help people.  In two of my service mission assignments, I help with customer service and talk to people who need help finding thigs at Deseret Industries, and I help people fulfill food orders at The Bishopsâ€™ Storehouse.  I also became certified to operate a forklift at the storehouse.
When you decide to hire me, you will get someone who is honest and hard working.  Even though I prefer a quiet work environment, I do get along well with others.  To the point of honesty, I sometimes need help from someone to help me with typing, if it is required.  I know the material and what I am supposed to do, but sometimes my brain can get a bit stuck with transferring my thoughts onto paper.
I hope you have found my resume to be helpful and look forward to hearing from you soon.
